### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelancer coding girl trying to get better at whatever I'm doing.
Currently, I'm working on AI related things, because everyone seems to do AI...

Two things I still want to get into is Emacs and tmux, the cool coders I look up to
are constantly taking about it, so it feels like I should know

I love gaming and playing with my kids and fooling around with whatever runs on semiconductors...
I dream that my little girls can live in a world where coding girls are as normal as boys dancing ballet.

Be _awesome_!
